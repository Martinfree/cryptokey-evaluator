 ```
Report:
 1. "api -fast" not working correct with pass
 2. format returned string api for winapi problematic
 3. maybe some of output must be not in stdout(it's useless)
 4. Need to Machine-cmds (without useless output)
 5. fast-check --analyze-pass have problems with arithmetic
 ```

3. v0.3 (api v0.7 functionality and UI update) 24.05 ✘ last commit: [86797770eb05959ac4d17ee157af0dc3dfa544b0](https://github.com/Martinfree/cryptokey-evaluator/commit/86797770eb05959ac4d17ee157af0dc3dfa544b0)
```
Report:
 1. PS C:\cryptokey-evaluator\Win32App\cryptokey-evaluator> ./api.exe --cracking-resistance --hash-file=d.hash --secret-file=.seckey
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::logic_error'
  what():  basic_string::_M_construct null not valid
  when no "--format="
  2. No stdout from attacks
```
4. v0.4 ( make threads and calls better, make all work 100% correctly with logic) 25.05

5. v0.5 (Open file and make all working for several cyph at the same time. api v0.8) 

6. v0.6 (Make config your attack and make hashcat work with you) 25.05

7. v0.7 (Powershell console) 26.05

8. v0.8 (Design cracking-resistance result and make possible to download report) 26.05

9. v0.9 (build winapi prog with new structure and connect api v 0.9) 27.05

10. v1.0 (all is ready and tested) 27.05
